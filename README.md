# fx-CG100 port of CELESTE Classic

This is a port of [Lephenixnoir's port](https://git.planet-casio.com/Lephenixnoir/ccleste) of [lemon32767's ccleste](https://github.com/lemon32767/ccleste), which is a C rewrite of Celeste Classic.

This code is in no way good or clean; it's hacks on top of hacks on top of hacks.

Good luck.

Build with:

```sh
make clean celeste.g3a
```
