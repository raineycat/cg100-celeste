# fx-CG 50 port of CELESTE Classic

This program is a trivial adaptation of lemon32767's [ccleste](https://github.com/lemon32767/ccleste),
which is a C rewrite of the PICO-8 CELESTE game. See the original README file
at [README-ccleste.md](README-ccleste.md).

This was done in an evening, there was no attempt at keeping the code clean.

Build with:

```
% make USE_GINT=1 celeste.g3a
```
